# Titanic_Survival
A  Titanic Survival Prediction app using a stacked ensemble of machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) with SHAP explanations for feature contributions. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model stacking, and explainable AI, all in Streamlit app suitable for  portfolio projects.

# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predict Titanic passenger survival using machine learning and explainable AI.

## Overview

This project uses a **stacked ensemble** of machine learning models:

- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost (stacked)  

Additionally, **SHAP** is used to interpret feature contributions, and a **Streamlit app** allows interactive survival predictions.

- Sex  
- Age  
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)  
- IsAlone (derived from family info)  
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)  
- Deck
